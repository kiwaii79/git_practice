<hr>
<ol>
<li>This is a simplified trading algorithm I created that buys securities when their 10-day (short-term) moving-average line crosses their 50-day (long-term) one from below (called a golden cross) and sells all of them when the opposite occurs (called a death cross). The algorithm is written in Python and the electronic platform is called Quantopian.

<ul>  
<li>Alpha - (+) return in excess of what would be expected for the risk </li>
<li>Beta - (+) returns usually have the same sign as the benchmark </li>
<li>Sharpe - (+) risk-adjusted performance </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>This is additional output that is given when my algorithm is backtested.
  
<ul>  
<li>Structural Constraints - measures how many recommended APIs are being used </li>
<li>Risk Constraints - measures how well the algo controls certain factors </li>
</ul>
