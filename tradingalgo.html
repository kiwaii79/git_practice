<li>This is an example of an algorithm I created that buys securities when the short-term moving average line crosses the long-term one from below (golden cross) and sells them when the opposite occurs (death cross). The algorithm is written in Python and the electronic platform is called Quantopian.
<ul>
<li>Alpha - (+) return in excess of what would be expected for the risk </li>
<li>Beta - (+) returns usually have the same sign as the benchmark </li>
<li>Sharpe - (+) risk-adjusted performance </li>


</ul>

<li>This is additional output that is given when my algorithm is backtested.</li>
