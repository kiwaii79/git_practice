<div class='container'">
	<p> Hey, my name is Robby! I started climbing in 2014 when I decided to take a Climbing PE class at my undergrad school, Cornell University, on a whim. 
	Because I enjoyed climbing so much, I decided to continue climbing at a local gym where I have instructed many classes and have been pushing V9.  
	I've incorporated all of these exercises into my routine at one point or another so I hope you find them useful too!
