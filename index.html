  <h2>Hello! </h2>
  <p>Are you new to climbing but trying to get a fast start or an experienced one trying to get to the next level?  
  If you are, these exercises will help you meet your goals by challenging you in fundamental and unfamiliar ways. 
  </br>

  There are a few common characteristics of the exercises I have included: </p>
  <p> <span class="bold">Bodyweight Only:</span> Being able to manipulate your body is one of the most important aspects of climbing and because this is already
  very challenging, added weight is usually unnecessary. </p>
  <p>
  <span class="bold">Free-weight:</span> Being able to manage mobile weight focuses your core and saves time by working out multiple muscles at once. As a result of this, however, proper form is very important.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="bold">Targeted:</span> While climbing can challenge almost every part of your body, it is most efficient to train only certain parts in order to 
   see noticeable progress, save time/energy and prevent unnecessary mass gain.

  	<p>If you would like a simple workout to boost overall ability, these exercises are for you.
  	</br><span class="bold">Ring hold isometric </span> By doing these, you can calibrate yourself and feel out where to center your weight between the rings.  Start with a set of gymnastics rings shoulder-width apart and at waist height. 
  	Stand between the rings and push down on them hard. 
  	Once this engages your muscles, jump off the ground and hold yourself up in this mantling position 
  	(similar to movement you use when getting out of a pool via the side).
  	</br><span class="bold">Ring Push-ups:</span> With the rings shoulder-width apart and a few inches off the ground, get into a push-up position with the ring openings facing towards you.
  	Perform push-ups as you normally would, with your hands moving further apart as you go down.
  	</br><span class="bold">X Push-ups: </span>These are almost a total-body exercise.  Assume a normal push-up position with your legs and arms spread wider than your shoulders.  
  	Your arms should also be higher than shoulder height. Perform push-ups as you normally would. 
  	</br><span class="bold">Leg-ups: </span> Leg-ups will help your feet on roofs. Lie on the ground with your back touching it.  Lift your legs up and above your head.
  	Make sure to keep your lower back on the ground and visualize pulling your feet towards your head instead of flipping them over your waist.
  	</br><span class="bold">Push-ups: </span>One would be remiss to not advise these.

  <span class="bold">Ring Flies: </span>This is one of my favorite exercises that I've seen Alex Megos do. Ring Flies will allow you to hang more actively on the wall and build compression strength.  Set the rings shoulder-width apart and a few inches off the ground.
  Put your hands into the rings and rest on your knees.  
  </br> Variations: 
  Lean onto your hands and bring them apart so your nose almost touches the ground.
  To target your pecs more, you can perform these with your arms rotated outwards so your palms are facing away from you.
  To adjust difficulty you can allow/prevent your feet from lifting up as you go down.
  Another way to adjust difficulty is to lower down as if you were doing a ring push-up instead of keeping your arms straight throughout the movement. 
  To do it Flies full difficulty, you can start from a normal push-up position instead.
  </br><span class="bold">Superman Flies: </span>This is similar to the Ring Flies except when you lean onto your hands, you bring them forward.
  In this way, they stay roughly shoulder-width apart as you go down. This will target your abs more than the normal Flies.
  </br><span class="bold">Ring Dips: </span>These are much harder than normal dips and it is recommended you flare the rings out each time you reach the top of the movement.
  </br><span class="bold">Dragon Flags: </span>Dragon Flags are extremely difficult so one should work up to them using leg-ups and negatives.
  </br><span class="bold">Planche Push-ups: </span>This an easily-adjustable gymnastics exercise that builds pushing power.

  <span class="bold">Scapular Pull-ups: </span>Acquiring scapula (shoulder blade) strength results in greater control of your arms since your scapula helps control them.
  The way to perform these is to hang on a bar with your hands shoulder-width.
  First, you want to sink your head between your shoulders then you want to shrug so you enter an active hang.
  </br><span class="bold">Superman Flies: </span>This is similar to the Ring Flies except when you lean onto your hands, you bring them forward.
  In this way, they stay roughly shoulder-width apart as you go down. This will target your abs more than the normal Flies.
  </br><span class="bold">Front Lever: </span> The Front Lever is well-known for being the one of the hardest pushing/core exercises amongst gymnasts and for good reason. 
  If you need inspiration, just watch Sean McColl doing it.

  Lower body strength is not as important as lower body flexibility, namely in the hip flexors and adductors. 
  This is because flexibility is what allows you to place head-high heel hooks, reach very far footholds, and stay closer to the wall 
  whereas strength is really only tested when stepping off a single foothold with one leg.
  A good benchmark is being able to do a single pistol squat on each leg.

	<div class="page-header"> <h1> Reps + Sets </h1></div>

  <h3> Form a plan! Pick 2-3 exercises under each of the following headers and do them 3-4 times a week.  
  You should stick to these for at least ~6 weeks to see results instead of attempting "muscle confusion". </h3>
  <p class="well">If training power, complete ~5 sets each with ~5 reps. 
  Take up to ~3 minutes rest between sets.  You can take more or less time as long as you feel fully recovered before starting new sets.  
  During the following week, you should try to add 1 more rep to each set.  
  Then, once you can do 7-10 reps per set, you would need to add ~5% more weight (factoring bodyweight) and reset to ~5 reps/set. </p> 
  <p class="well">If training endurance, complete ~3 sets each with 10 reps. Take .5-1 minute rest between sets. 
  You want to take shorter rests so that you work out your muscles to exhaustion.  
  Also, you should do as many reps as you are able in the final set. 
  During the following week, you should try to add 1 more rep to each set.  
  Then, once you can do 15-20 reps per set, you would need to add ~5% more weight (factoring bodyweight) and reset to ~10 reps/set</p> 
  <p>Don't overexert yourself. This goes without saying but there are a lot of options at your disposal you're feeling overworked:
  	</br>Reduce weight
  	</br>Switch to a different variation of the exercise
  	</br>Hold in the contracted position (isometric)
  	</br>Come out of the contracted position slowly (perform a negative/eccentric)
  	</br>Stop the set
  </br>As you can see, there are many options that aren't even mutually exclusive that can keep you safe from injury but still keep your time-under-tension high per set (~40sec).
