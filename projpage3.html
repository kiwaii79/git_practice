</li>
<li>Enter how much you would like to deposit/withdraw in the box under Amount.</li>

<li>To the right of the box, click the circle next to Deposit or Withdraw. </li>
<li>Click "Execute."</li>
<li>If you withdrew more than your current balance from a Checking Account, then you will be charged an Overdraft fee of $30 which will also be deducted from the balance.</li>
<li>A screen will appear indicating the amount you attempted to deposit/withdraw, the ID of the account, the starting/ending balance, and whether the action occurred. If the returned value is "true," the withdrawal/deposit was successful. If it is "false," then it was unsuccessful. </li>
<li>A few conditions will cause the action to be unsuccessful:

<ul>
<li>Withdrawing/Depositing a negative amount.</li>
<li>Attempting to withdraw too much from your savings account.  This is when withdrawing would cause the balance to drop below the minimum required balance.</li>
<li>Attempting to withdraw from a savings account too many times within a month.</li>
</li>
</ul>
